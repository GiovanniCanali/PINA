"""
Module for vectorized differential operators implementation.

Differential operators are used to define differential problems and are
implemented to run efficiently on various accelerators, including CPU, GPU, TPU,
and MPS.

Each differential operator takes the following inputs:
- A tensor on which the operator is applied.
- A tensor with respect to which the operator is computed.
- The names of the output variables for which the operator is evaluated.
- The names of the variables with respect to which the operator is computed.

Each differential operator has its fast version, which performs no internal
checks on input and output tensors. For these methods, the user is always
required to specify both ``components`` and ``d`` as lists of strings.
